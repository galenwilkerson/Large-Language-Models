# Large Language Models Exploration

This repository contains a collection of notebooks exploring the capabilities of large language models using Hugging Face Transformers.

## Notebooks

### 1. Sentiment Analysis with Hugging Face

In this notebook, we perform sentiment analysis on text using the Hugging Face Transformers library. We utilize a pre-trained model to classify text into different sentiment categories, demonstrating how to leverage state-of-the-art natural language processing models for sentiment analysis tasks.

**Notebook:** [Sentiment Analysis with Hugging Face](notebooks/Sentiment_Analysis_with_Hugging_Face.ipynb)

### 2. Dialogue Generation with Distilled GPT-2

This notebook showcases the use of a distilled GPT-2 model to create a dialogue between two chatbots. We explore how to generate conversational text using a smaller and more efficient version of the GPT-2 model, making it accessible for dialogue generation tasks.

## Getting Started

To run these notebooks, you'll need Python and the necessary libraries installed. You can set up the required environment by following these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/large-language-models-exploration.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd large-language-models-exploration
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Open and run the notebooks using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required libraries (install using `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

## Usage

Each notebook provides step-by-step instructions and code examples to perform sentiment analysis or generate dialogues with large language models.
