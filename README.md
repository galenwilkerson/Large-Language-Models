A few notebooks playing with Large Language Models:

First, a small project to perform sentiment analysis on text with using HuggingFace libraries.

Second, a project to use distilled GPT-2 model to create a dialog between two chatbots.

You will see that this is not very easy off the bat.   It certainly should help to use a more powerful computer and the full pre-trained GPT-2 model.
